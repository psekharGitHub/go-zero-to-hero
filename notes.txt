@ QUESTIONS
-----------------
- Difference between array and slice ?
- arrays have definite size, slices can have dynamic size

- use of range ?
- range keyword used to iterate over slice, map

- why inheritance is not supported by pointer receivers ?

- is Go an Object Oriented Programming language ?
    - in technical sense, it is not an OOP language, but most of the OOP features are
        implemented in Go, so OOP like language

- three data structures we talked about?
    - array, slice, map

@ HOMEWORK
------------------
- We want to build two data structures; queue and stack with push-pop functions.
    - methods : push(), pop()
    - data structures : slice

    - implement stack.go and queue.go using slices 
    - now write a client for stack.go and queue.go
        - Producer: 5 go routines tp push in stack.go / queue.go
        - Consumer: 5 go routines to pull from stack.go / queue.go

@ NOTES
------------------
- Arrays are contiguous in nature but after the defined size gets exhausted then last element 
    maintains a pointer to the new location where additional elements are going to be stored
- Slices are made at runtime with a pointer to the memory location
- Slices are made using ':=' and 'make' keyword
- ':=' is initialization + declaration, '=' is declaration
- Array has 'length' and Slice has 'capacity'

- JSON payload are string so big in size but 'proto' uses byte array as payload which are
    smaller and hence faster than JSON. So, more in use than JSON.

- Data Types
    - basic : int, float, string, boolean
    - composite: array, slice, map, struct

- Exception Handling
    - Checked Exceptions
    - Unchecked Exceptions
    - Defer : used to close resouces, exected at the end of a prog
    - panic is used for runtime error
    - 'panic' will exit immediately when triggered, then 'defer' will direct the control to 'recover'
    - 'defer' handles recovery even if there is no panic mentioned explicitely
    - defer is used to close out the live resources
    - defer functions are prioritized in LIFO order
    - defers are used for scenarios like for closing db connections etc
    - panic-defer-recover works like try-catch

- Functions
    - function may/may not have a name
    - function can have multiple return values
    - private: Starting with lowercase letter
    - public: Starting with uppercase letter
    - function must have a return statement, if it doesn't then it infers an integer return value

- Pass by reference
    - using pointers, pointers to pointers

- Variadic functions
    - passing integers in this function is always received as a slice in the function
    - slices are passed as reference, so passing a slice itself in variadic function, changes made in
        the function will impact the main slice in main function as well
    - 'append' is a variatic function itself. Using append on a slice creates a new slice with new reference

- Closure
    - function returning a function is Closure

-Structure Tags
    - Tags are used for validation of fields in a struct

- Methods
    - pointer receivers changes are global, impact the actual value of fields
    - changes made in value receivers are local, won't impact the actual values

- Composition vs Inheritance
    - composition: has-a relationship
    - inheritance : is-a relationship

- Inheritance
    - inheritance is implemented using interface

- Polymophism
    - Go supports polymorphism(i.e. function overriding)

- Encapsulation
    - provided using exported or unexported identifiers. achieved by exported elements(variables, functions, methods,
        fields, structures) from the packages, it helps to control the visibility of the elements(variables, 
        functions, methods, fields, structures)

- Abstraction
    - provided using interface

- Interface
    - interface in Go is a collection of functions or other interfaces, not variables.
    - composite interface is an interface of interfaces
    - Type-Switch/blank interface is used to build functions that work on multiple types of data
    - every type implements an interface as a default type, so a function with blank interface parameter can
        accept any type of arguments

- Parallelism vs Concurrency
    - single process(p) run by 6 different processors at the same time is called Parallelism
    - 6 processes(p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6) run by 6 different processors at the same time is called Concurrency
    - Go routine and Go channels are used to implement concurrency
    - main function is also a Go routine
    - normal functon call uses main stack, and Go routines uses their own stack

- A single processor can have multiple processes
- A single process can have multiple threads
- thread is a sequence of instructions with a program counter
- OS allocates 16MB space working memory/space
- OS takes some time to prepare for scheduling the threads
- Go takes liberty of scheduling the threads by itself without OS intervention. 
- Go have their own schedulers, interact with RAM directly. So saves a lot of time

- There is only one main Go routine
- CPU is capable of running multiple processes, but how fast will it run will depend on the cores
- Go provides more than any other language:
    - low latency: fast response
    - scalability: reponse time when you have million requests
- speed against ease-of-use is the trade off in Go

- Go routines run in ambiguous order. No fixed order
- Channels are way to communicate between Go Routines
- Synchronization
    - Mutex, Lock variables, channels are options.
    - channels are preferrable to others
    - 'Channel' is a variable/type/memory location in your heap
